# Code for Coding Engineers
![CodingforEngineers](assets/CodingforEngineers.jpg)

This is the code repository for my ongoing book project, **Coding for Engineers**. The book is [published chapter by chapter over at PicoGK.org](https://picogk.org/coding-for-engineers/).

The code is organized by chapter, and each chapter has a namespace reflecting that chapter, so we don't have collisions with equally named code symbols, as we progress through the book.

Coding for Engineers [relies on PicoGK, our free and open-source geometry kernel](https://github.com/leap71/PicoGK), which I wrote in 2023, and that we actively maintain at [LEAP 71](https://leap71.com/).

All example source code is released under [Creative Comons CC0 "No rights reserved"](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), unless otherwise specified. No guarantess and warranties are made of any kind, obviously. Use at your own risk.

PicoGK is included as a submodule and is subject to its own licensing terms.
